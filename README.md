Lab0: Setting up github and self-introduction
## Intro!
Hi, 

I am Sayan, a 5th year PhD candidate in the School of Engineering. I'm pursuing my Doctoral Certifiate from DSI. I am from Calcutta, India. Would eat practically anything. Love Boba!! 

I am interested in applying data driven techniques towards ab-initio atomistic simulations. Love New England summer and fall, the beaches and the nearby mountains. Picked up a liking for cooking during the quarantine. See you all in person soon!
